The rally on Saturday was a new experience for William Udozorh, a biochemistry freshman who came with the Texas Rising group.I came here to protest because my entire life, I was told to not have an argument because of what happen to black people who argue.In the news, you see people getting killed just because you differ on one issue, Udozorh said.Thats why Im here.Now Im older.Im 18.I can vote for who I want to and choose a side.

President Richard Benson sent out an email to faculty and staff on Friday, calling on the university to begin the new academic year with resolve in light of the ignoble events. Benson stated UTD would not tolerate behavior or speech on campus that is meant to defame, violate the law or incite violence.

One of our own students, who was protected under DACA, was taken by ICE earlier this year, Briggs said.Its huge.The biggest thing that us as students can do to make a massive impact is voting in Richardson and Plano, because those areas are at the tipping point. Texas Rising students ended the night by paying their respects to Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer during the tealight candle vigil.Photo by Valerie Perez | Mercury Staff.I think the rally went really well, very peaceful, said Ilene Mokhayeri, a healthcare studies senior and member of Texas Rising at UTD.Opinions can change the world.If youre out here protesting for a good cause, more and more people can see the effect it has, and maybe itll help to stop violence in the future.Coming out here, I feel a lot better about these issues.
