The McCallum office couldnt give Lee any details about the fire.He could see some of the fragments and ashes floating out through the air, but because his apartment building was not the one on fire, he said everything remained normal for him.Photo courtesy of Hamilton Lee.This does make you wonder about the value of renters insurance, he said.You Might Also Like Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.
