With winds up to 195 mph, the typhoon was one of the strongest storms ever recorded.The typhoons death toll has reached at least 3,600 as of Nov. 15, according to a report by the Associated Press.Bernadas said he saw devastating photos his cousin took of a house where his family lived near the waterfront off a main road of Tacloban, which is still standing but sustained heavy damage.I just feel helpless, he said.We all thought it was just another typhoon, like hurricane season here, but once we heard the news  all this death and destruction  it hit hard because being here knowing that you want to do as much as you can, but theres not a whole lot because youre across the ocean. He plans on going to visit his family there as soon as he can to see that theyre safe and out of harms way.Advertisement Bernadas said students can help by donating to organizations such as the Philippine Red Cross, Save the Children and the Catholic Relief Service.Whatever anyone can do, whether its donate to these organizations, send their thoughts or even pray, it will help, Bernadas said.Computer science senior and president of the Filipino Student Association Nikki De Ocampo said she also has family in the country, but luckily they werent in the hardest hit area.De Ocampo said the Office of Student Volunteerism is providing an online page where students can donate to the relief effort at http://utdallas.edu/volunteer.She also said the FSA is holding a talent show in December of which all the proceeds will go to the relief effort.More information can be found at the FSA Facebook page.You Might Also Like Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.
