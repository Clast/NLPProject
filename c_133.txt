As of mid-August the Conference Center has been officially renamed the Alexander Clark Center.The change is in response to a decision made by the UT System Board of Regents earlier this spring.The building is named in honor of Alexander Clark, former vice president of academic affairs, who passed away summer 2009, said Vice President of Business Affairs Richard Dempsey.Advertisement According to a meeting between university officials, the Clark Center will be refurnished and food and drink will be prohibited.Over the next year, certain events will gradually be removed from the building in an attempt to promote more formal interactions, such as guest speakers and lecture series.Dempsey said a dedication will be held later this fall.Advertisement You Might Also Like Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.
