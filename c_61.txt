In its first official partnership with a college campus, Booster Fuels offers students and staff alike with a unique service.Booster Fuels staff refuels peoples cars as they go about their day  a service that costs just as much as filling up at a gas station.Using Booster Fuels official app, users can schedule for an 800-gallon fuel truck to top their cars off anytime during their operating hours, which is every weekday between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.The user determines within what time frame the service is delivered, with the normal options being 5-hour or 3-hour delivery.But Booster Fuels is now offering a 1-hour delivery option exclusive to UTD.Advertisement People have often referred to us as the Uber of gas, which is not a bad comparison, said Ryan Leech, director of sales and campus representative from Booster Fuels.The companys presence can be seen everywhere on campus.From representatives setting up stands at the plinth to promote the service, to the 2-3 bright purple fuel trucks that are seen roaming the parking lots on any given day, Booster Fuels has been getting the word out.I love the convenience of being able to fill-up my car during classes, its made for one less thing I have to worry about in my day to day, said Nicholas Glezman, an economics sophomore.Shivani Bhatnagar, a biochemistry junior, had a positive experience with the service her first time using it.Advertisement I thought it was really neat, and the entire process (of using the app) was much simpler than I thought it would be, Bhatnagar said.Right now the only product provided by Booster Fuels is gas delivery, but it may not be long until the company expands its services.In mid-February, probably at the latest, there will be add-on services that you can get like a windshield wash, tire shine, wiper replacement  as well as tire check and tire replacement, Leech said.Booster Fuels is also looking to expand to other colleges in Dallas and corporate campuses.Even though the company is still in its beginning stages, its sights are set high.We dont want to be a flash in the pan.What we want to work toward is the phasing out of gas stations, Leech said.You Might Also Like Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.
