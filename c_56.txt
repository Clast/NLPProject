Faculty members and graduate students from the Arts and Humanities Department participated in a read-in on Feb. 7.From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to combat the ideas represented in the American Vanguard fliers posted on campus last week.Professors and students read passages from works they had individually selected.On-looking students and faculty members were invited to sit down, listen and discuss.Advertisement Lora Burnett, an A&amp;H lecturer, came up with the idea after white nationalist posters were found tacked on the walls of the Jonsson Academic Center.When I heard about the fliers posted around the university, it just seemed to me that we needed to do something that expressed a different message to people about what UTD stands for and what A&amp;H wants people to get out of being in college, she said.We dont want people to get a message of exclusion or fear. For Burnett, using literary works to convey a humanistic message was best for idealistic and practical reasons.Its pretty natural for humanists to turn to books, she said.Turning to the texts we study every day and using them was just the best thing to do.(Its) a kind of demonstration that is not intimidating to someone who has never done this before.(Its) a very natural gesture  for us to sit in a circle and not have to come up with our own words.Its visible and welcoming to students.

Heinz agreed with Burnett that using literary works to get a point across was effective.We as humanists have something to contribute to this conversation that is rooted in an understanding of historical perspective, of literary expression that stretches across regions, stretches across times to really draw on the wisdom of those who came before us, she said.One of the things that stood out was the sense that many of those ideas and sentiments still hold so much power and relevance even if they were written hundreds of years ago.
