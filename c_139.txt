To advance female representation in the STEAM fields and help foster connections among those female students, University Housing is piloting a program in fall 2017 called Women in STEAM, which will be a new Living Learning Community on campus.From the LLC website, Living Learning Communities are groups of freshman students who share academic goals and interests  live in designated residence halls, enroll in community-specific courses and participate in group activities designed to enhance learning.

A major purpose for this program is to construct a pipeline for female students to follow from elementary school to their professional careers after college.Through various outreach and service activities, Women in STEAM will work to create a natural thread that future generations of female students can follow, Partain said.Women in STEAM is the first of its kind at UTD in its creation of a community of female students who are empowered by common connections.We definitely want to expand the program after this pilot run is a success, so that anyone who wants to be in the community and is eligible can be accepted, Straach said.Partain and Straach have decided to extend the deadline another month to April 21, because they want to make sure that as many eligible students as possible have a chance to apply.There are no added costs to being a part of the Women in STEAM program.We truly just want to do our part in helping to build an environment where young women can achieve their goals, Partain said.You Might Also Like Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.
