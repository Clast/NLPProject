In a previous version of this article Todd Fechters name was misspelled, The Mercury regrets this error.The Edith ODonnell School of Arts and Technology may undergo a restructuring of the schools two degree programs.The proposed change would merge ATEC and EMAC and bring additional changes to the graduate program.Final approval from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board could come as early as May.Advertisement Were anticipating its going to go very well at the state level.Were not going to on day five of fall semester say, All classes are cancelled. Were not going to do that. Were moving forward anticipating approval, said Eric Farrar, associate dean of undergraduate studies, at the town hall.On April 5, ATEC faculty and staff held a town hall for undergraduates, the first public forum since the changes were announced a month ago.After a short presentation discussing details and dispelling rumors, Farrar, Senior Associate Dean Todd Fechter, ATEC Dean Anne Balsamo and Associate Dean of Academic Administration Lisa Bell, as well as other advisors and faculty members answered questions about the future of ATEC.The plan is to fuse ATEC and EMAC into one unified program named Art, Technology and Emerging Communication.The update would also implement a portfolio review and incorporate five pathways, or specializations, for students to choose from: animation, games, critical media studies, design and production or mediated communication.(We wanted to make) a larger more cohesive program and the other thing  is the ability of the current degree program to pick and choose and not dive deep into any one particular topic, Farrar said.It doesnt do the students service if theyre not forced to get deeper into a particular topic. Advertisement A common theme among students at the town hall was concern about the availability of classes needed to satisfy degree requirements.Several professors were not renewed for the fall, leaving courses potentially unavailable.While ATEC could fill as many as seven tenure-track and 12 non-tenure professor positions, the statewide hiring freeze is delaying the process.We have to wait until August for our new hiring plan. The entire state is under a hiring freeze so were very lucky we got a lot of our jobs posted before then, Balsamo said.Our next phase is as soon as the hiring freeze is lifted. We hope to have people lined up so once the jobs are posted we can start taking applications. Another difficulty ATEC faces in hiring faculty is recruiting experienced industry professionals who have an academic background or are interested in teaching at a university.Finding qualified industry professionals that also have the academic credentials that allow them to teach at the university level, its hard, Farrar said.People that are in production number one are not necessarily looking for academic jobs, or they dont know or they dont think theyre qualified meaning they dont have the academic credentials to teach at a university. However, a new professorial job introduced by the UT System Board of Regents called professor of practice would allow ATEC to hire an industry professional that does not have a masters or doctoral degree.While the process began at the administrative level over a year ago, for many students, such as sound design sophomore Catharine Nanagas, news of the restructuring was surprising and sparked rumors such as game design or sound design being eliminated from ATEC.I wish that they had done this earlier because  rumors fester and even if we dispel them the feeling is still there, she said.The timing is really off but Im glad theyre opening it up and theyre saying, This is what were doing and we want your questions and we want you input and its better late than never. However, Farrar said the administration couldnt disseminate information about the program until it was finalized.Thats why for some of you it seems like its being done in a black box with a lack of transparency.Its not because we didnt want to share it with you guys, its because were limited by the state exactly what we can share with you once we get final approval, he said at the town hall.With all of these changes coming by next fall, Nanagas said she wishes ATEC administration had communicated with students better.Im going to be a junior next year and I even asked a question about what theyre doing infrastructure wise while theyre looking for faculty and they gave a vague answer for something thats happening in a few months and thats a little bit disheartening, she said.Thats the issue going on right now and of course they have a lot to think about in terms of long and short term but as a personal note I just wish they had more to say now.
